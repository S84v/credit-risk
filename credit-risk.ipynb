    "# üìä Credit Risk Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict credit risk by determining which customers are likely to pay their loans on time and which are not. We'll employ various data science techniques and methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
    "   - Analyze the dataset to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and check assumptions using statistical summaries and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize data, and split into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **‚≠ê Feature Importance**:\n",
    "   - Identify key features influencing `loan_status` to improve model performance and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **üîΩ Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",
    "   - Use techniques like PCA to reduce the number of features while retaining essential information, speeding up model training, and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **ü§ñ Predictive Modeling**:\n",
    "   - Build various models (logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting) to predict `loan_status`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **‚öôÔ∏è Hyperparameter Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Perform hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search) to find the best parameters for our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **üß™ Model Testing**:\n",
    "   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC to test performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict the `loan_status` to determine the likelihood of customers paying their loans on time. This helps financial institutions make informed loan approval decisions and manage risk effectively.\n"
